| `clean.go`          | Cleans/normalizes URLs and resolves relative links against a base URL. For example, if we are currently on `https://github.com/` and we have the href `/nishoof`, cleaning it would give `https://github.com/nishoof`.                                                  |
| `crawl.go`          | Crawls the provided href. First downloads the page. Then extracts the words and hrefs. Cleans the hrefs. Then repeats the crawling process using the new hrefs. Uses a queue and tracks visited URLs to avoid cycles. Returns a map from URLs to their extracted words. |
| `download.go`       | Downloads the contents of a web page using HTTP and returns a readable stream for further processing.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `extract.go`        | Extracts relevant unique words and hrefs, skipping unwanted elements like `<style>` and `<script>`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `inverted_index.go` | Implements an inverted index that maps words to a map mapping the documents (URLs) they appear in to their frequency in that document. Provides methods including the search method, which returns a list of documents ranked/sorted by relevance.                      |
| `stop.go`           | Checks if a word is a stop word. Stop words are common words that we should filter out.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tfidf.go`          | Implements the TF-IDF ranking to determine how relevant a document is to a search word.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
