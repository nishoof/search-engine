| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clean.go`           | Cleans/normalizes URLs and resolves relative links against a base URL. For example, if we are currently on `https://github.com/` and we have the href `/nishoof`, cleaning it would give `https://github.com/nishoof`.                                                  |
| `crawl.go`           | Crawls the provided href. First downloads the page. Then extracts the words and hrefs. Cleans the hrefs. Then repeats the crawling process using the new hrefs. Uses a queue and tracks visited URLs to avoid cycles. Returns a map from URLs to their extracted words. |
| `download.go`        | Downloads the contents of a web page using HTTP and returns a readable stream for further processing.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `extract.go`         | Extracts relevant unique words and hrefs, skipping unwanted elements like `<style>` and `<script>`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `index_in_memory.go` | An in-memory inverted index (implementing the Index interface) that maps words to another map mapping the documents (URLs) the words appear in to the word's frequency in that document.                                                                                |
| `index_interface.go` | Defines the interface for an index to search for documents using keywords. Provides methods including the search method, which returns a list of documents ranked/sorted by relevance. The increment method should be called for every occurrence of every word.        |
| `stop.go`            | Checks if a word is a stop word. Stop words are common words that we should filter out.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tfidf.go`           | Implements the TF-IDF ranking to determine how relevant a document is to a search word.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
