| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clean.go`           | Cleans/normalizes URLs and resolves relative links against a base URL. For example, if we are currently on `https://github.com/` and we have the href `/nishoof`, cleaning it would give `https://github.com/nishoof`.                                                  |
| `crawl.go`           | Crawls the provided href. First downloads the page. Then extracts the words and hrefs. Cleans the hrefs. Then repeats the crawling process using the new hrefs. Uses a queue and tracks visited URLs to avoid cycles. Returns a map from URLs to their extracted words. |
| `download.go`        | Downloads the contents of a web page using HTTP and returns a readable stream for further processing.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `extract.go`         | Extracts relevant unique words and hrefs, skipping unwanted elements like `<style>` and `<script>`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `index_in_memory.go` | An in-memory inverted index (implementing the Index interface) that maps words to another map mapping the documents (URLs) the words appear in to the word's frequency in that document.                                                                                |
| `index_interface.go` | Defines the interface for an index to search for documents using keywords. Provides methods including GetFrequency() which gets the frequency of a given word in a given document. The increment method should be called for every occurrence of every word.            |
| `index_sqlite.go`    | An SQLite-based inverted index (implementing the Index interface). Uses an SQLite database to store the index persistently on disk. Uses 3 tables: `documents`, `words`, and `frequencies`.                                                                             |
| `robots.go`          | Used by crawl to parse the `robots.txt` file of a website to make sure we're following its rules (including crawl delays and disallowed paths).                                                                                                                         |
| `search.go`          | Searches the index for documents matching the provided words. Calculates a TF-IDF score for each document with at least one occurrence of the search word and returns a list of results (containing document URL, score, and num of occurrences).                       |
| `stop.go`            | Checks if a word is a stop word. Stop words are common words that we should filter out.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tfidf.go`           | Implements the TF-IDF ranking to determine how relevant a document is to a search word.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
