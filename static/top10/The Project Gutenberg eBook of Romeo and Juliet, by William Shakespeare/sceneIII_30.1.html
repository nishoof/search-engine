<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:<br/>
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,<br/>
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,<br/>
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a
tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no need
of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Am I like such a fellow?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon
moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
And what to?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill
the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a
hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for
cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of
quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle
as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the
street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst
thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me
from quarrelling!
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of
my life for an hour and a quarter.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
The fee simple! O simple!
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Tybalt</span> and others.</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
By my head, here comes the Capulets.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
By my heel, I care not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.<br/>
Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a word and
a blow.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me occasion.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us, look
to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s that
shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
We talk here in the public haunt of men.<br/>
Either withdraw unto some private place,<br/>
And reason coldly of your grievances,<br/>
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.<br/>
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Romeo</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.<br/>
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;<br/>
Your worship in that sense may call him man.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford<br/>
No better term than this: Thou art a villain.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br/>
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br/>
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;<br/>
Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<br/>
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I do protest I never injur’d thee,<br/>
But love thee better than thou canst devise<br/>
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.<br/>
And so good Capulet, which name I tender<br/>
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!<br/>
[<i>Draws.</i>] Alla stoccata carries it away.<br/>
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
What wouldst thou have with me?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to make bold
withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight.
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine
be about your ears ere it be out.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TYBALT.<br/>
[<i>Drawing.</i>] I am for you.
</p>

<p class="drama">

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.<br/>

Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.<br/>

BENVOLIO.<br/>
What, art thou hurt?
</p>

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.<br/>

Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO.<br/>
No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but
’tis enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find
me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’
both your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I thought all for the best.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br/>

Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!<br/>
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d<br/>

O cousin, cousin.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;<br/>
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink<br/>
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal<br/>
Your high displeasure. All this uttered<br/>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d<br/>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br/>
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br/>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,<br/>
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br/>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br/>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br/>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br/>
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,<br/>
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,<br/>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br/>
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br/>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br/>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.<br/>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br/>
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,<br/>
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I<br/>
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;<br/>
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.<br/>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
He is a kinsman to the Montague.<br/>
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.<br/>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br/>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br/>
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;<br/>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.<br/>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;<br/>
His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br/>
The life of Tybalt.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
And for that offence<br/>
Immediately we do exile him hence.<br/>
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,<br/>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.<br/>
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br/>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.<br/>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br/>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.<br/>
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,<br/>
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.<br/>
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.<br/>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
