<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br/>
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner<br/>
As Phaeton would whip you to the west<br/>
And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br/>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br/>
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo<br/>
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.<br/>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br/>
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,<br/>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br/>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<br/>
And learn me how to lose a winning match,<br/>
Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.<br/>
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,<br/>
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,<br/>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br/>
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br/>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br/>
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.<br/>
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,<br/>
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,<br/>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br/>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br/>
That all the world will be in love with night,<br/>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br/>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<br/>
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,<br/>
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day<br/>
As is the night before some festival<br/>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<br/>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,<br/>
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks<br/>
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Nurse,</span> with cords.</p>

<p class="drama">
Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?<br/>
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Ay, ay, the cords.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Throws them down.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!<br/>
We are undone, lady, we are undone.<br/>
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Can heaven be so envious?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Romeo can,<br/>
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.<br/>
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?<br/>
This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.<br/>
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,<br/>
And that bare vowel I shall poison more<br/>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.<br/>
I am not I if there be such an I;<br/>
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.<br/>
If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.<br/>
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,<br/>
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.<br/>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<br/>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,<br/>
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.<br/>
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.<br/>
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,<br/>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.<br/>
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!<br/>
That ever I should live to see thee dead.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br/>
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?<br/>
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?<br/>
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,<br/>
For who is living, if those two are gone?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,<br/>
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!<br/>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br/>
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,<br/>
Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!<br/>
Despised substance of divinest show!<br/>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,<br/>
A damned saint, an honourable villain!<br/>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell<br/>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br/>
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?<br/>
Was ever book containing such vile matter<br/>
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell<br/>
In such a gorgeous palace.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
There’s no trust,<br/>
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,<br/>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br/>
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.<br/>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<br/>
Shame come to Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Blister’d be thy tongue<br/>
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.<br/>
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;<br/>
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d<br/>
Sole monarch of the universal earth.<br/>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br/>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,<br/>
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?<br/>
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br/>
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.<br/>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,<br/>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br/>
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.<br/>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,<br/>
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.<br/>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br/>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,<br/>
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,<br/>
But O, it presses to my memory<br/>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.<br/>
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.<br/>
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’<br/>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death<br/>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.<br/>
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,<br/>
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,<br/>
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,<br/>
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,<br/>
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?<br/>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,<br/>
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word<br/>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br/>
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,<br/>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br/>
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.<br/>
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.<br/>
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,<br/>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.<br/>
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,<br/>
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.<br/>
He made you for a highway to my bed,<br/>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br/>
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,<br/>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo<br/>
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.<br/>
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.<br/>
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,<br/>
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
