<h3><a name="sceneIII_30.3"></a><b>SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Friar Lawrence</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.<br/>
Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts<br/>
And thou art wedded to calamity.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Romeo</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?<br/>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,<br/>
That I yet know not?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Too familiar<br/>
Is my dear son with such sour company.<br/>
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,<br/>
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;<br/>
For exile hath more terror in his look,<br/>
Much more than death. Do not say banishment.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hence from Verona art thou banished.<br/>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
There is no world without Verona walls,<br/>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br/>
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,<br/>
And world’s exile is death. Then banished<br/>
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,<br/>
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,<br/>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!<br/>
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,<br/>
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,<br/>
And turn’d that black word death to banishment.<br/>
This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here<br/>
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,<br/>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br/>
Live here in heaven and may look on her,<br/>
But Romeo may not. More validity,<br/>
More honourable state, more courtship lives<br/>
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br/>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,<br/>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br/>
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty<br/>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.<br/>
But Romeo may not, he is banished.<br/>
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.<br/>
They are free men but I am banished.<br/>
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?<br/>
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,<br/>
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,<br/>
But banished to kill me? Banished?<br/>
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.<br/>
Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,<br/>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br/>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,<br/>
To mangle me with that word banished?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,<br/>
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,<br/>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.<br/>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br/>
Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,<br/>
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
O, then I see that mad men have no ears.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.<br/>
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br/>
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br/>
Doting like me, and like me banished,<br/>
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,<br/>
And fall upon the ground as I do now,<br/>
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Knocking within.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans<br/>
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Knocking.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,<br/>
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Knocking.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,<br/>
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Knocking.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.<br/>
I come from Lady Juliet.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Welcome then.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Nurse</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,<br/>
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.<br/>
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!<br/>
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,<br/>
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.<br/>
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.<br/>
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.<br/>
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Nurse.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?<br/>
Doth not she think me an old murderer,<br/>
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy<br/>
With blood remov’d but little from her own?<br/>
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says<br/>
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;<br/>
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,<br/>
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,<br/>
And then down falls again.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
As if that name,<br/>
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br/>
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand<br/>
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,<br/>
In what vile part of this anatomy<br/>
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack<br/>
The hateful mansion.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Drawing his sword.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hold thy desperate hand.<br/>
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.<br/>
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote<br/>
The unreasonable fury of a beast.<br/>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,<br/>
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br/>
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,<br/>
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.<br/>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?<br/>
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,<br/>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br/>
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?<br/>
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet<br/>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br/>
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,<br/>
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,<br/>
And usest none in that true use indeed<br/>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.<br/>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br/>
Digressing from the valour of a man;<br/>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br/>
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;<br/>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br/>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br/>
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,<br/>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br/>
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.<br/>
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,<br/>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.<br/>
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,<br/>
But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.<br/>
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,<br/>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.<br/>
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;<br/>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br/>
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,<br/>
Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.<br/>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br/>
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,<br/>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.<br/>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br/>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;<br/>
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time<br/>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br/>
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back<br/>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br/>
Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.<br/>
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,<br/>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br/>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.<br/>
Romeo is coming.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night<br/>
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!<br/>
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.<br/>
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:<br/>
Either be gone before the watch be set,<br/>
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.<br/>
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,<br/>
And he shall signify from time to time<br/>
Every good hap to you that chances here.<br/>
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,<br/>
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.<br/>
Farewell.
