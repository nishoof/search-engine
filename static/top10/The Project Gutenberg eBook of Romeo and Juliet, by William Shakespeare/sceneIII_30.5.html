<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.<br/>
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<br/>
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;<br/>
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.<br/>
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<br/>
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks<br/>
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.<br/>
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br/>
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<br/>
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.<br/>
It is some meteor that the sun exhales<br/>
To be to thee this night a torchbearer<br/>
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.<br/>
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,<br/>
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br/>
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,<br/>
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.<br/>
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat<br/>
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<br/>
I have more care to stay than will to go.<br/>
Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.<br/>
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.<br/>
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br/>
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br/>
Some say the lark makes sweet division;<br/>
This doth not so, for she divideth us.<br/>
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.<br/>
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,<br/>
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br/>
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.<br/>
O now be gone, more light and light it grows.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

JULIET.<br/>
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,<br/>
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<br/>
For in a minute there are many days.<br/>
O, by this count I shall be much in years<br/>
Ere I again behold my Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
I will omit no opportunity<br/>
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET.<br/>
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve<br/>
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!<br/>
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,<br/>
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.<br/>
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.<br/>
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.

O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,<br/>
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him<br/>

For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long<br/>
But send him back.

Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?<br/>
Is she not down so late, or up so early?<br/>
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Lady Capulet</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Why, how now, Juliet?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Madam, I am not well.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?<br/>
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br/>
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.<br/>
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,<br/>
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br/>
Which you weep for.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Feeling so the loss,<br/>
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death<br/>
As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What villain, madam?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
That same villain Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Villain and he be many miles asunder.<br/>
God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.<br/>
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.<br/>
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.<br/>
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,<br/>
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,<br/>
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram<br/>
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:<br/>
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Indeed I never shall be satisfied<br/>
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—<br/>
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.<br/>
Madam, if you could find out but a man<br/>
To bear a poison, I would temper it,<br/>
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,<br/>
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br/>
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,<br/>
To wreak the love I bore my cousin<br/>
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.<br/>
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
And joy comes well in such a needy time.<br/>
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;<br/>
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,<br/>
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,<br/>
That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn<br/>
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,<br/>
The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,<br/>
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,<br/>
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.<br/>
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed<br/>
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.<br/>
I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,<br/>
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear<br/>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br/>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,<br/>
And see how he will take it at your hands.

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;<br/>
But for the sunset of my brother’s son<br/>
It rains downright.<br/>
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?<br/>
Evermore showering? In one little body<br/>
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.<br/>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br/>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br/>
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,<br/>
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,<br/>
Without a sudden calm will overset<br/>
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?<br/>
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br/>
I would the fool were married to her grave.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br/>
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?<br/>
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,<br/>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br/>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.<br/>
Proud can I never be of what I hate;<br/>
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?<br/>
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;<br/>
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,<br/>
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,<br/>
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next<br/>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,<br/>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br/>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!<br/>
You tallow-face!
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br/>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!<br/>
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,<br/>
Or never after look me in the face.<br/>
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.<br/>
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br/>
That God had lent us but this only child;<br/>
But now I see this one is one too much,<br/>
And that we have a curse in having her.<br/>
Out on her, hilding.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
God in heaven bless her.<br/>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,<br/>
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
I speak no treason.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
O God ye good-en!
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
May not one speak?
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
Peace, you mumbling fool!<br/>
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,<br/>
For here we need it not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
You are too hot.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
God’s bread, it makes me mad!<br/>
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,<br/>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br/>
To have her match’d, and having now provided<br/>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br/>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,<br/>
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,<br/>
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,<br/>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br/>
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,<br/>
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,<br/>
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’<br/>
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.<br/>
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.<br/>
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.<br/>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.<br/>
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;<br/>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,<br/>
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,<br/>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.<br/>
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br/>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br/>
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,<br/>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,<br/>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br/>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.<br/>

O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br/>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.<br/>
How shall that faith return again to earth,<br/>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br/>
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.<br/>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br/>
Upon so soft a subject as myself.<br/>
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br/>
Some comfort, Nurse.

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Faith, here it is.<br/>
Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing<br/>
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.<br/>
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br/>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br/>
I think it best you married with the County.<br/>
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.<br/>
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,<br/>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br/>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br/>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br/>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br/>
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,<br/>
As living here and you no use of him.

Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br/>
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,<br/>
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,<br/>
To make confession and to be absolv’d.

So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.<br/>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br/>
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.<br/>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
