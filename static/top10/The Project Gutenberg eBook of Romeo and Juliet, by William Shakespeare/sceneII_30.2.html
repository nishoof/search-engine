<h3><a name="sceneII_30.2"></a><b>SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Romeo</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"><span class="charname">Juliet</span> appears above at a window.</p>

<p class="drama">
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?<br/>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!<br/>
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,<br/>
Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br/>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.<br/>
Be not her maid since she is envious;<br/>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br/>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br/>
It is my lady, O it is my love!<br/>
O, that she knew she were!<br/>
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br/>
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.<br/>
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.<br/>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br/>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br/>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br/>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br/>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br/>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br/>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<br/>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br/>
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.<br/>
O that I were a glove upon that hand,<br/>
That I might touch that cheek.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Ay me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
She speaks.<br/>
O speak again bright angel, for thou art<br/>
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,<br/>
As is a winged messenger of heaven<br/>
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br/>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br/>
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds<br/>
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?<br/>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.<br/>
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br/>
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br/>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br/>
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,<br/>
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br/>
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.<br/>
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose<br/>
By any other name would smell as sweet;<br/>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,<br/>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br/>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br/>
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,<br/>
Take all myself.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I take thee at thy word.<br/>
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;<br/>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night<br/>
So stumblest on my counsel?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
By a name<br/>
I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br/>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br/>
Because it is an enemy to thee.<br/>
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br/>
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.<br/>
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br/>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br/>
And the place death, considering who thou art,<br/>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,<br/>
For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br/>
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:<br/>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br/>
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,<br/>
And I am proof against their enmity.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,<br/>
And but thou love me, let them find me here.<br/>
My life were better ended by their hate<br/>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;<br/>
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br/>
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far<br/>
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,<br/>
I should adventure for such merchandise.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,<br/>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br/>
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.<br/>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br/>
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.<br/>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,<br/>
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,<br/>
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,<br/>
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br/>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br/>
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br/>
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,<br/>
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.<br/>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;<br/>
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:<br/>
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true<br/>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br/>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br/>
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,<br/>
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,<br/>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<br/>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,<br/>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,<br/>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br/>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
What shall I swear by?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Do not swear at all.<br/>
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br/>
Which is the god of my idolatry,<br/>
And I’ll believe thee.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
If my heart’s dear love,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br/>
I have no joy of this contract tonight;<br/>
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,<br/>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br/>
Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.<br/>
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,<br/>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br/>
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest<br/>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;<br/>
And yet I would it were to give again.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
But to be frank and give it thee again.<br/>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;<br/>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br/>
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br/>
The more I have, for both are infinite.<br/>
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.<br/>
[<i>Nurse calls within.</i>]<br/>
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.<br/>
Stay but a little, I will come again.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,<br/>
Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br/>
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Juliet</span> above.</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br/>
If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br/>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,<br/>
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,<br/>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,<br/>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay<br/>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] Madam.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,<br/>
I do beseech thee,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] Madam.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
By and by I come—<br/>
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.<br/>
Tomorrow will I send.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
So thrive my soul,—
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
A thousand times good night.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.<br/>
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,<br/>
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Retiring slowly.</i>]</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Re-enter <span class="charname">Juliet,</span> above.</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice<br/>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.<br/>
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,<br/>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br/>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine<br/>
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
It is my soul that calls upon my name.<br/>
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,<br/>
Like softest music to attending ears.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Romeo.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
My nyas?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
What o’clock tomorrow<br/>
Shall I send to thee?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
By the hour of nine.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.<br/>
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br/>
Remembering how I love thy company.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br/>
Forgetting any other home but this.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,<br/>
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,<br/>
That lets it hop a little from her hand,<br/>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br/>
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br/>
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I would I were thy bird.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Sweet, so would I:<br/>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br/>
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow<br/>
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.<br/>
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.<br/>
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,<br/>
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
</p>
