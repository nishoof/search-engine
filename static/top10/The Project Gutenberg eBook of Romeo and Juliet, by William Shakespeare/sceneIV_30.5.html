Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.<br/>
Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!<br/>
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!<br/>
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.<br/>
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,<br/>
The County Paris hath set up his rest<br/>
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!<br/>
Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!<br/>
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!<br/>
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,<br/>
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?<br/>
What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?<br/>
I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!<br/>
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!<br/>
O, well-a-day that ever I was born.<br/>

Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,<br/>
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.<br/>
Life and these lips have long been separated.<br/>
Death lies on her like an untimely frost<br/>
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET.<br/>
Ready to go, but never to return.<br/>
O son, the night before thy wedding day<br/>
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,<br/>
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.<br/>
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;<br/>
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die<br/>
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.

PARIS.<br/>
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,<br/>
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.<br/>
Most miserable hour that e’er time saw<br/>
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.<br/>
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,<br/>
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,<br/>
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.<br/>
Most lamentable day, most woeful day<br/>
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!<br/>
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.<br/>
Never was seen so black a day as this.<br/>
O woeful day, O woeful day.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.<br/>
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,<br/>
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.<br/>
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.<br/>
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now<br/>
To murder, murder our solemnity?<br/>
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,<br/>
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,<br/>
And with my child my joys are buried.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not<br/>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br/>
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,<br/>
And all the better is it for the maid.<br/>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br/>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br/>
The most you sought was her promotion,<br/>
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,<br/>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d<br/>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br/>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill<br/>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.<br/>
She’s not well married that lives married long,<br/>
But she’s best married that dies married young.<br/>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br/>
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,<br/>
And in her best array bear her to church;<br/>
For though fond nature bids us all lament,<br/>
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
All things that we ordained festival<br/>
Turn from their office to black funeral:<br/>
Our instruments to melancholy bells,<br/>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;<br/>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;<br/>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<br/>
And all things change them to the contrary.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,<br/>
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare<br/>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.<br/>
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;<br/>
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

Why ‘Heart’s ease’?

O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is
full’. O play me some merry dump to comfort me.

Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.

No.</p>

No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the

Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

<p class="drama">
SECOND MUSICIAN.<br/>
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.

Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?

THIRD MUSICIAN.<br/>
Faith, I know not what to say.

O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is ‘music
